- 👋 Hi, I’m @rahmantahiba (Tahiba Rahman) a beginner but determined about programming. I'm currently studying at Rochester Institute of Technology searching for a summer internship. My code is public to show others my learning process and the small steps taken to work on my projects. 

- 👀 I’m interested in expanding my horizons and continue my innovations by learning various programming languages. I'm hoping to work in a professional environment to offer my skills and the process of learning never stops!

- 🌱 I’m currently learning:

--> HTML
--> CSS
--> SQL 
--> C/C++

Currently working on game development projects and building my own portfolio website!

- 💞️ Fun fact: I made an entire presentation about how important collaboration is in development for my final project. I don't get many opportunities to learn alongside others often but I look forward to collaboration.

--> Collaboration + Diverse Skillsets = Innovation!
