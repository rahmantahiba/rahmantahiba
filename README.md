- 👋 Hi, I’m @rahmantahiba (Tahiba Rahman), determined and passionate to innovate. My code is public to show others my learning process and the small steps taken to work on my projects. 

- 👀 I’m interested in expanding my horizons and continuing my innovations by learning various programming languages. I'm hoping to work in a professional environment to offer my skills, and the process of learning never stops!

- 🌱 My goal is to continue advancing in:

--> HTML
--> CSS
--> SQL 
--> C/C++
--> More to come! 

Currently working on game development projects. I hope to improve my web development abilities to build my portfolio website.

- 💞️ Fun fact: I made an entire presentation on the importance of collaboration in technological projects for my final project since I'm passionate about sharing my expertise. I look forward to learning alongside others.
  
--> Collaboration + Diverse Skillsets = Innovation!
